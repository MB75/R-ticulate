### Exercise 2 - Writing functions in R

a. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of the relative variability of a dataset compared to its mean. It is 
defined as the ratio of the standard deviation ($\sigma$) to the mean ($\mu$): 

$$
CV = \left(\frac{\sigma}{\mu}\right) \times 100 %
$$
The CV provides a standardised measure of dispersion, allowing for the comparison of variability between datasets with different units of measurement or scales. Larger CV values indicate greater relative variability, while smaller CV values indicate lower relative variability.

Write a function that calculates the CV and apply it to the two simulated datasets with varying dispersion below.

```{r coefvar_exercise, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, comment=NA}
## Fixing the seed of the random number generator to ensure that we share the same two sets of random values
set.seed(456)

## Create two random samples from a normal distribution
dat1 <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 5, sd = 1)
dat2 <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 5, sd = 2)
```

```{r coefvar_exercise-solution, exercise.reveal_solution=TRUE}
## Custom function for the caluclation of the coefficient of variation
cv <- function(x) {sd(x, na.rm = T)/mean(x, na.rm = T) * 100}
cv(dat1) # dat1 has a smaller standard deviation and thus smaller CV than dat2
cv(dat2) 
```

b. The volume of a sphere is given by the equation:


$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3} $$
where $r$ indicates the radius. 
<br>
Write an R function that calculates the volume of a sphere based on its radius. Use your newly created function to compute the volume of a sphere with _r_ = 5 cm.
</p>

```{r sphere_exercise, exercise=T, comment=NA}
```

```{r sphere_exercise-solution, exercise.reveal_solution=TRUE}
sphere_vol <- function(x) { 4/3 * pi * x^3 }
sphere_vol(x = 5)
```

c. Now we can step it up a notch and write a versatile function that converts temperatures from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. The two corresponding conversions are:

$$y~째C = (x~째F - 32) \times 5/9$$
$$y~째F = (x~ 째C \times 9/5) + 32$$
Have a look at the first example in the help file of the `switch` function and mimic it when devising the temperature conversion function.
```{r temp-conv-exercise, exercise=T, comment=NA}
```

```{r temp-conv-exercise-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = TRUE}
## Custom function for the conversion of temperatures from degree Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa
convert_temp <- function(x, type) { 
  switch(type, 
         FtoC = (x - 32) * 5/9,
         CtoF = x * 9/5 + 32
         )
}

## Convert 0 째C to 째F
convert_temp(x = 0, type = "CtoF")

## Convert 95 째F to 째C
convert_temp(x = 95, type = "FtoC")
```
